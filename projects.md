# Portfolio Projects

## 1. Treatment Effects Policy Evaluation

**Objective**: Measure causal impact of social assistance program on employment outcomes

**Challenge**: Selection bias in program participation required sophisticated econometric approach

**Methodology**: 
- Implemented Heckman two-stage selection model
- Designed and executed field survey (n=2,500)
- Applied robustness checks using propensity score matching and instrumental variables

**Results**: 
- Identified 15% positive treatment effect on employment probability (p<0.05)
- Found program most effective for participants aged 25-40
- Recommendations influenced $50M budget reallocation

**Technical Implementation**: Python for data processing, R for econometric modeling, Stata for validation

## 2. Economic Impact Analysis Using RDD

**Objective**: Assess employment effects of minimum wage increases in border counties

**Challenge**: Isolate causal effects from confounding economic factors

**Methodology**:
- Applied regression discontinuity design exploiting geographic boundaries
- Analyzed administrative employment data (2015-2020)
- Implemented bandwidth optimization and robustness testing

**Results**:
- Found minimal negative employment effects (-0.02 elasticity)
- Results contradicted traditional economic predictions
- Analysis cited in state legislative hearings

**Technical Implementation**: R for statistical analysis, GIS tools for geographic analysis, Tableau for visualization

## 3. Financial Risk Assessment Model

**Objective**: Develop actuarial risk model for insurance product pricing

**Challenge**: Balance competitive pricing with adequate risk coverage

**Methodology**:
- Built ensemble machine learning model combining traditional actuarial methods
- Incorporated external economic indicators and demographic trends
- Implemented Monte Carlo simulation for stress testing

**Results**:
- Improved risk prediction accuracy by 18%
- Reduced premium pricing errors by $2.3M annually
- Model deployed across 5 product lines

**Technical Implementation**: Python (scikit-learn, pandas), SQL for data extraction, Excel for client reporting
